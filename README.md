```

There are two files including the stimuli (constructed_data.txt and corpus_data.txt) and two files including the mixed-effect models (constructed_model.txt and corpus_model.txt) for each study. In addition, examples can be found in the file data_examples.pdf. Both files are tab separated and are composed of the following information:

## constructed data:
 Verb	\t	Type of context	\t	Context sentence	\t  Prompt 

## corpus data:
 Type of pronoun	\t	Context sentence	\t  Prompt 



The corpus data is extracted from ParcorFull, an English-German parallel corpus annotated with full coreference.
